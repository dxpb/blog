Welcome back! Today we tackle the results of a test.

I saw the following lines cross the output logs from a build slave:

```
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15 PKGGRAPH_MSG_WORKERCANHELP:
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     proto_version=grph00
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     addr=0
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     check=0
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     pkgname='google-chrome'
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     version='68.0.3440.106.1_1'
D: 18-08-26 04:26:15     arch='x86_64'
```

What's the problem here? The template for `google-chrome` is restricted, we
can't distribute it! It should never hit the builders.

So let's trace two problems:
First:

```
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22 PKGGRAPH_MSG_JOB_ENDED:
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     proto_version=grph00
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     addr=0
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     check=0
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     cause=0
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     pkgname='google-chrome'
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     version='68.0.3440.106.1_1'
D: 18-08-26 05:09:22     arch='x86_64'
```

The cause should not be 0. I just tested this, and xbps returns 2. We should
get a non-zero cause, not necessarily 2, but we should get errors from an enum
of possible error reasons. "Failed" is valid.

The second problem: how did this get requested at all.

Back to the first problem:

Let's start in pkggraph_worker.xml and see where we send JOB_ENDED at all:

```
<!-- snip -->
	<state name = "working" inherit = "defaults">
		<!-- snip -->
		<event name = "job ended" next = "preparing">
			<action name = "send" message = "JOB ENDED" />
		</event>
		<!-- snip -->
	</state>
<!-- snip -->
```

Let's find out where we get job_ended_event sent, this time in
pkggraph_worker.c:

```
static void
begin_building_pkg (client_t *self)
{
	// snip
	case BBUILDER_NOT_BUILDING:
		pkggraph_msg_set_cause(self->message, END_STATUS_OBSOLETE);
		engine_set_next_event(self, job_ended_event);
		break;
	// snip
}
```

But that's where we begin building the package (but you see what I mean about
the cause being selected from an enum), and is not used once the job has begun.

```
static void
get_log_data (client_t *self)
{
	// snip
	do {
		// snip
		zsock_brecv(self->provided_pipe,
				bbuilder_actions_picture[BBUILDER_LOG],
				&tmppkgname, &tmpversion, &tmparch, &tmplogs,
				&more, &buildEnd, &buildEndCause);
		// snip
		if (buildEnd) {
			pkggraph_msg_set_cause(self->message, buildEndCause);
			engine_set_next_event(self, job_ended_event);
			assert(more == 0);
		}
	} while (more);
	// snip
}
```

Okay, so now we know the buildEndCause isn't being properly populated. Let's go
find the other end of that pipe! Conveniently enough, it's the actor from
`bbuilder.c`, so we will go there next, and find `BBUILDER_LOG`:

```
bbuilder_handle_log_request(/* snip */)
{
/* snip */
	uint8_t buildStatus = 0;
/* snip */
	log = bxsrc_get_log(bd->fds, log_size, &done);
/* snip */
	if (done)
/* snip */
		buildStatus = bxsrc_build_end(bd->fds, *srcinstance);
/* snip */
	rc = zsock_bsend(pipe, bbuilder_actions_picture[action],
			bd->name, bd->ver, bd->arch, log, more,
			sendDone, buildStatus);
/* snip */
}
```

Since we only break out on `buildEnd` being true, and that can only be done
when `sendDone` is set true, we know the `cause` that sent us down this rabbit
hole is found in `bxsrc_build_end()` (completely copied here).

```
int
bxsrc_build_end(const int fds[], const pid_t c_pid)
{
	assert(fds[0] > 2 && fds[1] > 2);
	char buf[80];
	/* Close writing pipe */
	close(fds[1]);
	/* Wait for process to end */
	int retVal = 0;
	if (waitpid(c_pid, &retVal, WNOHANG) == 0)
		kill(c_pid, SIGTERM);
	waitpid(c_pid, &retVal, 0);
	/* Close reading pipe */
	unset_fd_o_nonblock(fds[0]);
	while (read(fds[0], buf, 79)) {
		;
	}
	close(fds[0]);
	return retVal;
}
```

Let's just try deleting the second waitpid, that probably is resetting retVal.

Committed, on to the next problem.

Let's fix up the build queue having restricted packages.

I want to be able to have restricted packages, but I also want to have no
restricted packages unless it's turned on. I can't really add it to the builder
messaging, and thus put the logic in the builders. Builder messaging was not
designed to provide much autonomy at all. The correct place to toggle
restricted mode is the grapher. So let's explore how we want to do that.

The natural place to do selection for what does or does not get into the queue
is under `bgraph`, namely in `bgraph_what_next_for_arch()` which calls
`bgraph_pkg_ready_to_build()`. In fact, the queue is entirely constructed by
those two functions. Since `pkg_read_to_build` really just checks if a package
has all of its dependencies ready or not, and is itself not ready, I don't want
to burden it with more logic. However, a filter on the resulting list in
`what_next_for_arch` would be ideal, especially for another desired feature:

```
/*
 * TODO: clean up retVal to include more of a subset of packages;
 * such as if bootstrap packages are wanted, only bootstrap packages,
 * or other such optimizations.
 */
```

How do I want to pass configuration in here? It's not really meant to be done
that way. I can add an argument later if I want to, but for now, restricted
packages will always be pruned from the build order. It's easier that way.

Now before returning the queue, we filter it to remove any unwanted packages,
the code has just been committed.

Next up, we try to figure out why the frontend is dying unexpectedly, using the
good-old scatter-puts()-calls-and-narrow-down-that-way technique.
